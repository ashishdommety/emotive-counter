# Attempt at redux stuff

## What I'm doing now:-
I've create a:
+ reducer
+ action
+ store

I'm then passing the store all the way down from the top to the components I want it to be in, and then am dispatching an action from there.
This reaches the reducer.

## What isn't working:-
1. Once it reaches the reducer, the changes are happening on the global state, but aren't reflecting on the DOM

## What I don't like / Questions:-
1. Passing the store down from the root component, and using it that way. 
2. How do I use mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps?
3. How do I incorporate container components?

# ‚ùóÔ∏è üí° üëΩ Update! 

It works!

## What I did?
1. Added all the redux stuff in App.js, and removed any notice of the components. In this case, App.js is the container component.
2. I then added another component called 'Display' that's purpose is to put the button and numbers components into one, while passing down the needed state and behaviour.
3. The presentational components then, essentially, can be functional because they have no state. They just have props. 
4. There is thus no local state, but one global state.
