# Attempt at redux stuff

## What I'm doing now:-
I've create a:
+ reducer
+ action
+ store

I'm then passing the store all the way down from the top to the components I want it to be in, and then am dispatching an action from there.
This reaches the reducer.

## What isn't working:-
1. Once it reaches the reducer, the changes are happening on the global state, but aren't reflecting on the DOM

## What I don't like / Questions:-
1. Passing the store down from the root component, and using it that way. 
2. How do I use mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps?
3. How do I incorporate container components?

## ‚ùóÔ∏è üí° Update! 

It works!
